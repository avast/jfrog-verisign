# jfrog-verisign

- JFrog plugin to verify deploying artifacts signatures. It supports both JAR verification and RPM (PGP verification). 

## Project info
- **Project maintainer:** Ladislav Vit√°sek ([vitasek@avast.com](mailto:vitasek@avast.com))
- **Requirements:**
    * Gradle 6.6+
    * JDK 11

It was tested with JFrog API version `artifactory-api:7.12.5`.

## General information
Plugin is used to verify deploying artifacts signature. If it fails, it returns HTTP status error with a detail message. 
It validates (if enabled) JAR like files (JAR, AAR) and RPM files.
The verification can be applied (via configuration file) only for specific repository paths. 

See more details about [JAR signing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/signing.html) and [how to sign RPMs with GPG](https://access.redhat.com/articles/3359321)..

## How it works

### JAR Verification
For JAR verification the plugin uses (to be more effective) modified JarSigner source code (launching a new JVM process is slow).
Signature is valid if JAR is signed, and it's verified by key stored in PKCS12 keystore. The key is identified by alias.  
Unsigned JAR is denied, and it's considered as an error.  

### RPM Verification
RPM utility does verification for RPM files (`rpm -Kv` command). It has to be available on the target OS system.  

Unsigned RPM is denied, and it's considered as an error.

## Usage

### Build
Use Gradle command (Windows) 
```bash
   gradlew.bat build
```
or (Linux/Mac)
```bash
   ./gradlew build
```


### Deploy & Configuration
For the steps 1-3 you can use `./gradlew deploy` task, which makes these steps 1-3 for you. Make sure you set correct `artifactoryPath` property in [`gradle.properties`](gradle.properties) file first.

1. Copy `jfrog-verisign.jar` (located in `/build/libs`) into JFrog's `var\etc\artifactory\plugins\lib` directory
2. Copy `verisign.groovy` (located in `/src/main/groovy`) into JFrog's `var\etc\artifactory\plugins`  directory
3. Copy `verisign.yaml` (located in `/etc/verisign.yaml`) into JFrog's `var\etc\artifactory\plugins`  directory
4. Define keystore file (for the JAR verification) and public PGP keys (for RPM verification, use command `rpm --import rpm.gpg.public`) on the JFrog's machines
5. Update `verisign.yaml` according to your needs
6. Restart JFrog


## Verisign.yaml file
It's recommended to link your `verisign.yaml` file with this [schema](/etc/verisign-schema.json), it can help you fix typos and to give you more hints (via ctrl/cmd+space).
